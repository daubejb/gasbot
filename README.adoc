Welcome Google Apps Script developers!
To avoid typing Google Apps Script dozens of more times, GAS will be used onwards.
This https://yeoman.io/[Yoeman] generator will quickly generate a
 https://developers.google.com/hangouts/chat/quickstart/apps-script-bot[GAS Hangouts Chat Bot].

== Value provided by gasbot

*By using this generator, you get an instant local development environment configuration for:*

- Boilerplate chat bot code
- JavaScript code linting
- TypeScript configuration
- Google Apps Script code auto-completion configuration
- Google clasp configuration

*The generator automatically creates the following files based on your input:*

- *Code.js* - The main script file.  On the GAS project, the file is named _Code.gs_
- *appsscript.json* - The GAS project _manifest_, specifies info needed to run
- *.clasp.json* - Stores the unique GAS scriptId for use in
 https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/clasp[clasp] functions
- *.claspignore* - Similar to .gitignore, what not to push to the GAS project
- *.eslintrc.json* - Rules and configurations for linting
- *.gitignore* - Specifies what files not to commit to git
- *.jsconfig.json* - Used for linting and auto-completion
- *package.json* - Specifies the https://www.npmjs.com/[npm]
 dependencies required to setup the GAS project

3. Then execute this command: `npm install -g generator-gasbot`
4. Create, name, and, save a *GAS project*
5. Copy or write down the projects *scriptId*
6. Within terminal, navigate to the location on your computer where you would like to store your

Notice that I did not enter a Script ID in the fourth question of the generator.
If you do the same, you will have to manually input the scriptID into the key value pair Within
 the `.clasp.json` file.
This file must have a valid ScriptId for the `clasp` command line utility to communicate with
 the GAS project.
